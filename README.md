# 🍽️ Hunger Hacker – Android App to Combat Food Waste

Hunger Hacker is an Android application developed as part of an innovation competition project, aiming to address the global challenge of food waste in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## 🌍 Project Background

Every year, tons of food are wasted globally, while many people still struggle with food insecurity. A significant portion of this waste comes from supermarkets discarding near-expiry products that could still benefit people in need. Similarly, individuals often have unused food that could be shared rather than wasted.

However, there is a lack of public platforms that effectively connect food donors (e.g., supermarkets, individuals) with potential recipients.

**Hunger Hacker** bridges this gap by creating a community-driven food-sharing platform, enabling people to donate, share, or receive surplus food in a timely and accessible way.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this app is to **reduce food waste** by enabling:
- Supermarkets to share food that is close to expiration, rather than discarding it.
- Individuals to offer food they no longer need to others in the community.
- Communities to have better access to food via real-time digital connections.

## 💼 Use Case Scenarios
- A local supermarket posts a notification about unsold bakery items available for free pickup before closing time.
- A student moving house posts leftover dry food for nearby neighbors.
- A food rescue volunteer connects with multiple donors and coordinates distribution via chat.
